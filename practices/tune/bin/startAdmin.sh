#This script is the common script for this course that starts the AdminServer on host01
#within a new terminal window named AdminServer. This script is called by our setup.sh scripts
#after the common cleanup.sh script is called to reset the domain to its original state.
#The setup script calls this script, the AdminServer starts, we wait for the server to successfully
#start, and execution is returned to the setup.sh or solution.sh script to do whatever configuration
#is needed prior to starting any managed servers. Managed servers that start after configuration will
#get the updated configuration from the AdminServer during startup.
